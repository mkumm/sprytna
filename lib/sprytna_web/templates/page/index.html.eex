<h2>Data Weaving</h2>
<p>
    Data Weaving is Sprytna's agile approach to addressing a wide range of data-centric challenges
    for small and mid-sized businesses.
</p>
<p>
    By analyzing and breaking down large projects into smaller addressable deliverables, you
    the customer can control the pace, budget, and results of your project. No long term commitments
    are required and you start getting wins as fast as possible.
</p>

<h2>Template Population and Validation</h2>
<p>Many critical business processes require the populating or feeding of data to forms and templates
    that you don't control and are difficult to manage.</p>
<p>Sprytna can often find ways to "pipe" data sources together and the export the data in a format that
    either works with the third-party requirements, or drastically lowers the time it takes.</p>

<h2>Correct, Enhance, and Improve Data</h2>
<p>Most organizations collect data over years which can lead to large inconsistencies, incorrect
and outdated information &mdash; all of which can feel overwhelming to correct.</p>
<p>Sprytna has experience evaluating data sets for missing data, inconsistencies, and flag
    suspect for later review. We can also help set up processes and services to help keep your
data clean and usable.</p>

<h2>Manage Growing and Data Projects</h2>
<p>Small data projects have a way of turning into large unmanageable data projects.</p>
<p>Sprytna can help you regain control.</p>

<h2>Replace and Augment Manual Data Entry</h2>
<p>A host of problems can be resolved by replacing manual processes with automated
    or assisted data entry to ensure your data validates and minimizes errors &mdash; saving time and grief.</p>

<h2>Fixing Data Silos</h2>
<p>Data silos exist when data from different sources need to be pulled together for soe purpose, but
the sources were never designed to share data.</p>
<p>Sprytna can often find ways to convert data real-time to "talk" to other systems.</p>
